#### SETTING UP A NEW BASIS ####
# (1) For each Basis, the isconvertible function should be 
#     overloaded to point to how it can be converted.
# (2) Each basis should have dim() implemented
# (3) If it makes sense, a routine to evaluate the
#     basis expansion should be implemented
# (4) A transform should be implemented in the Operators 
#     directory corresponding to the basis.
